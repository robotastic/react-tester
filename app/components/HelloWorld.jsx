      <p>This is a starter <a href="http://glitch.com">Glitch</a> app for React! 
        It uses only a few dependencies to get you started on working with 
        state handling via Redux:</p>

      <UnorderedList items={dependenciesArray} />

      <p>Look in <code>app/components/</code> for {componentsMade.length} example components:</p>

      <UnorderedList items={componentsMade} />
      
      <VoteContainer label="Upvote or downvote this app!"/>
    </div>
